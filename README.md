🍷 Wine Quality Prediction
This project predicts the quality of wine based on various chemical properties using a Machine Learning model (Random Forest Classifier).
It also includes an interactive Streamlit web app for easy testing of predictions.

📌 Features
Predict wine quality based on chemical inputs

User-friendly Streamlit interface

Displays wine quality score and its interpretation (Poor / Average / Good)

Machine Learning model trained on the famous Wine Quality Dataset

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn for data processing & model training

Random Forest Classifier for prediction

Streamlit for frontend UI

Joblib for saving/loading model and scaler
📊 Dataset
